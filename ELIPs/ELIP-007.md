# ELIP-007: BLS12-381 Curve Support

---

# Executive Summary

Integrating BLS12-381 enhances EigenLayer's scalability and security by enabling efficient, secure and compliant cryptographic signature aggregation. Higher bit security, standardized hash-to-curve and pre-existing best practice remote signing utilities makes this curve an ideal first class primitive for EigenLayer AVS teams.  

# Motivation

EigenLayer provides the cryptoeconomic foundations for secure, scalable, and flexible Active Validation Services (AVSs). As these services grow in complexity and scale, there is an increasing demand for advanced cryptographic primitives that enable efficient and secure signature aggregation schemes.

Integrating BLS12-381 directly addresses this need by offering a pairing-friendly elliptic curve with proven robustness and industry-wide adoption. Its incorporation into EigenLayer will empower AVSs with a reliable and widely supported cryptographic standard, facilitating interoperability and ease of integration with external tooling and services.

BLS12-381 provides superior bit security (128-bit), effectively future-proofing EigenLayer AVSs against evolving computational threats. Additionally, its standardized hash-to-curve method (as opposed to BN254 - see this [open security vulnerability](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware/issues/172)) ensures consistent and secure implementations across various services, significantly reducing potential attack surfaces.

The widespread ecosystem support for BLS12-381, including mature libraries and established remote-signing infrastructure, simplifies deployment and reduces development overhead for AVSs, allowing EigenLayer teams to focus on core service logic rather than cryptographic implementation details.

Ultimately, adding BLS12-381 as a first-class primitive enhances EigenLayerâ€™s security posture, scalability potential, and accessibility, enabling richer AVS functionality and fostering greater trust and adoption across the EigenLayer ecosystem.

# Features & Specification

## BLS12381 Verification Library

The equivalent of [the BN254 library](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware/blob/3fb5b61076475108bd87d4e6c7352fd60b46af1c/src/libraries/BN254.sol), but working with the precompiles introduced in the Pectra update compliant with [EIP2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537).

Implements the BLS signature scheme with the BLS12-381 cyphersuite as defined in [draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-04](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-04)

## BLS12381 Key Registrar Support

As defined in the [Key Registrar](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware/pull/481) feature, support for BLS12381 registration as a first class curve primitive would include:
-Inclusion in the CurveType enum
-Rogue Key Attack Prevention/ Proof of Possession on registration
-APK updates
-Support for all setter/getter methods established for BN254

## BLS12381 Stake Weighted Verification Support

The equivalent of the [BN254 BLS Signature Checker](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware/blob/3fb5b61076475108bd87d4e6c7352fd60b46af1c/src/BLSSignatureChecker.sol), for equivalent support the following would need to be implemented
-Signer APK construction derived from non-signer bitmap

Multi-quorum/operator set verification is highly recommended to *not be implemented* for this ELIP if possible, as the added complexity is highly use-case specific and adds friction for implementing teams.

## Rationale

Support for multi-quorum signature verification was removed due to increased complexity, reduced efficiency, and limited practical utility. Initially, multi-quorum verification aimed to optimize gas consumption by aggregating signatures across multiple quorums. However, this introduced substantial complexity in both contract logic and off-chain aggregation processes, leading to increased potential for bugs and audit complexity.

Practically, multi-quorum verification scenarios proved rare or unnecessary in typical EigenLayer use-cases. Individual quorum signature verifications simplify implementation, reduce attack vectors, improve auditability, and align closely with common AVS integration patterns. Consequently, focusing exclusively on single quorum verification enhances security, reduces complexity, and provides clear, predictable contract behavior.

## Security Considerations

Integrating BLS12-381 as a cryptographic primitive introduces specific security considerations that must be carefully managed to maintain EigenLayer's security posture:

### Collision Resistance of Message Hashes

It is crucial that all messages hashed for signature verification are collision-resistant. EigenLayer AVS teams must ensure that message inputs cannot be manipulated to produce identical hashes, which could enable signature replay attacks. Thus, messages must include unique, domain-separated, and collision-resistant elements.

### Proper Use of Domain Separation Tags (DSTs)

When employing hash-to-curve operations (RFC 9380), correct usage of Domain Separation Tags (DSTs) is essential. Failure to correctly apply DSTs can lead to signature collisions across different applications, potentially allowing attackers to reuse valid signatures maliciously. Therefore, all implementations must follow standardized DST usage.

### Aggregation Pitfalls

While BLS signatures facilitate efficient aggregation, improper aggregation processes can introduce vulnerabilities. Aggregated signatures must always correspond correctly to their aggregated public keys, and AVS operators must carefully manage non-signers' public keys to avoid false validations. The Ethereum implementation or [`commonware`](commonware.xyz) (for a more decoupled , modular , avs native design) can serve as a reference for how to implement aggregation.  

### Reliance on Precompiles

EigenLayer's integration heavily relies on BLS12-381 precompiles, which are EVM implementation-dependent. Teams should monitor underlying platform changes (e.g., EVM upgrades) closely, promptly adapting implementations to maintain compatibility and security guarantees (*especially on L2s*).

### Key Management Practices

As cryptographic strength depends heavily on secure key management, AVS operators must enforce robust key lifecycle management, including secure generation, storage, rotation policies, and proactive key revocation procedures to prevent unauthorized access or compromise. [Web3Signer](https://github.com/Consensys/web3signer) is a widely adopted and maintained solution that may be utilized for this.

Addressing these considerations ensures the secure, efficient, and reliable use of BLS12-381 signatures within EigenLayer's AVS ecosystem.

## Impact Summary

### Enhanced Scalability and Efficiency for AVS teams

Integrating BLS12-381 significantly enhances cryptographic operation efficiency through signature aggregation, substantially reducing on-chain data storage and computational overhead. This reduction directly translates into lower gas costs, optimizing the overall scalability and performance of EigenLayer AVS deployments.

### Strengthened Security Guarantees for Operators

The integration of BLS12-381 enables higher security standards for operators, empowering stringent private key management practices.

### Simplified Aggregation and Reduced Operational Complexity for L2/Estranged L1 support

Existing threshold aggregation methods for BLS12-381 (as opposed to BN254) allow leveraging a single AVS public key,  dramatically reducing gas complexity. Moreover, this singular aggregation method eliminates the operational overhead associated with maintaining the APK across separate, non-Ethereum execution environments such as Layer-2s or other Layer-1 chains.

### Standardization and Interoperability

By adopting the standardized BLS12-381 curve, EigenLayer aligns itself with widely accepted cryptographic standards (RFC 9380). This standardization ensures interoperability with existing cryptographic libraries, tools, and practices, thereby reducing integration friction and enhancing operational consistency.

In summary, integrating BLS12-381 offers substantial operational, security, and compliance benefits, streamlining EigenLayer operations and enhancing its resilience and scalability.

# Action Plan
