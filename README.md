# EigenLayer Improvement Proposals (ELIPs)

This repository tracks EigenLayer Improvement Proposals. These are discrete units of protocol governance outlining improvements to EigenLayer [core contracts](/contracts.md).

## Whatâ€™s an ELIP?
EigenLayer Improvement Proposals (ELIPs) are the primary mechanisms for proposing new features and upgrades to the EigenLayer core contracts. ELIPs are version-controlled design documents that detail the motivation, technical specification, rationale, implementation path, and impact evaluation of specific proposals impacting core contracts. ELIPs are used to:

* Track progress while designing, building, and implementing new features
* Publicly communicate new features, designs, and create space for community input
* Propose new upgrades for approval & execution

To submit an ELIP, open a [pull request](https://github.com/abbey-titcomb/test-eigenlayer-core-dev/pulls). Ongoing and accepted proposals can be found in /elips. 

## ELIP Process
In the early stages, ideas for ELIPs and early drafts should be discussed on [forum.eigenlayer.xyz](https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/). The following actions require an ELIP:

* Upgrades/modifications to EigenLayer core contracts
* Modifications to multisig governance architecture (i.e. transferring ownership / admin access)
* Modifying minting rights over the bEIGEN token

Please refer to [forum.eigenlayer.xyz](https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/) for developer discussion around current and future ELIPs.

## Who can submit ELIPs?
In this early stage, [Eigen Foundation](https://eigenfoundation.org/) and [Eigen Labs](https://www.eigenlabs.org/) are the only entities that can accept proposals for improvements to the EigenLayer core contracts. The ELIP process is being introduced to provide the EigenLayer ecosystem with more transparency and clarity on upcoming changes. 

## Who manages the ELIP process?
The [Eigen Foundation](https://eigenfoundation.org/) maintains the ELIP repository and process.
